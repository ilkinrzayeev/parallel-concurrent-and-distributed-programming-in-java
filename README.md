A showcase of my solutions to core projects from Rice University’s “Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java” course on Coursera. This repository brings together hands-on implementations that explore the principles and real-world techniques of modern Java concurrency, parallelism, and distributed systems—demonstrating both technical depth and practical application.
